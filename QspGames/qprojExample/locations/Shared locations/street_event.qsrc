!!Can this be changed. How it is coded now it is really hard to add new random street events with how the code is done. How it was meant to be is the first group can happen anywhere, second group in the city only and thirds group in Pav. Perhaps doing it like you did the school breaks would be a better way than it currently is so we can add new events easily in the future.
